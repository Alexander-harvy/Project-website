                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Front End Tutorial was founded in this year 2025 with a simple mission: to make web development accessible to everyone. Our founders noticed that while there were many resources available online, most were either too complex for beginners or too basic for those wanting to advance their skills.</p>
                    <p>We set out to create a comprehensive learning platform that guides students through a natural progression from HTML to CSS to PHP, with each lesson building upon previous knowledge. Our structured approach ensures that learners develop a strong foundation while preparing for real-world development challenges.</p>
                    <p>Today, we've helped thousands of students transform from complete beginners to confident web developers through our carefully crafted tutorials, practical exercises, and supportive community.</p>
